This repository contains a collection of shell scripts that has been used by me to automate common tasks I do in Arch Linux. These scripts have been used by me to increase my productivity and time. Feel free to try it out. The scripts here do not have any kind of instructions of what it is so i will be adding those things later when i update the repo next time.
